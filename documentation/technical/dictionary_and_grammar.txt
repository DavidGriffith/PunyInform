Extra data in dictionary:

byte 0 & $1 : Verb flag
byte 0 & $2 : Meta flag
255 - (byte 1) : Verb number (255 - value is for "traditional Infocom reasons")


Grammar table is always located at the start of static memory (address pointed to by word at $0e in header). Word (Verb number) points to the start address for the grammar for a verb.

Grammar for a verb:
Byte 0: Number of grammar lines for this verb + 1
Byte 1 ... Syntax line 0, 1, ...


Grammar line

0: Highbyte of action_value
1: Lowbyte of action_value

(action_value & $0400) = 1 means the action is reversed

action = action_value & $03ff

3 bytes per token:
    byte 0 & $0f : token_type
    byte 1 + 2 : Token data
If token_type = 15 (ENDIT_TOKEN), this is the end of line, and byte 1 and 2 are not supplied.


ILLEGAL_TT         = 0;    ! Types of grammar token: illegal
ELEMENTARY_TT      = 1;    !     (one of those below)
PREPOSITION_TT     = 2;    !     e.g. 'into'
ROUTINE_FILTER_TT  = 3;    !     e.g. noun=CagedCreature
ATTR_FILTER_TT     = 4;    !     e.g. edible
SCOPE_TT           = 5;    !     e.g. scope=Spells
GPR_TT             = 6;    !     a general parsing routine
ENDIT_TOKEN        = 15


Grammar for Quit, grammar version 1:
01 Number of grammar lines

00 params wanted
ff token 1
00 token 2
00 token 3
00 token 4
00 token 5
00 token 6
00 action number


02 Grammar line 1, highbyte of action routine
bd Grammar line 1, lowbyte of action routine


Tokens available in grammar version 1:
NOUN_TOKEN         = 0;    ! The elementary grammar tokens, and
HELD_TOKEN         = 1;    ! the numbers compiled by Inform to
MULTI_TOKEN        = 2;    ! encode them
MULTIHELD_TOKEN    = 3;
MULTIEXCEPT_TOKEN  = 4;
MULTIINSIDE_TOKEN  = 5;
CREATURE_TOKEN     = 6;
SPECIAL_TOKEN      = 7;
NUMBER_TOKEN       = 8;

ENDIT_TOKEN = 15 ! Legal, but doesn't seem to be used

Prepositions are located in the "adjectives table". The start address is in the constant #adjectives_table .
Each entry consists of two words. If the second word is the preposition-number (like $ff), the first
word is the address of the dictionary word. There is no length number or end marker. You should just expect
to find the entry somewhere in there.
