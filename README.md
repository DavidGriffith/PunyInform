# PunyInform

PunyInform is a collection of libraries written in Inform that allow people to create Interactive Fiction (IF games, aka adventure games). It provides a parser and stdlib for the z-machine, designed to perform well on old 8-bit computers. 

## Motivation

The main goal of PunyInform is to be small and efficient, which will allow it to work efficently on older architectures, such as the 8 bit computers of the 1980s. Our main target is to make games that run well on the Commodore 64 with [Ozmoo](https://github.com/johanberntsson/ozmoo/).


## Status

The project has just been started and there is nothing ready to test yet.
