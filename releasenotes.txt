1.0: first public release (5 July 2020)

1.1: bug fix release (12 July 2020)
- Parsing failed for big story files because of bad pointer comparisons
- A programming error lead to bad parsing results on older interpreters
- Reimplemented darkness handling as described in DM4
- Fixed various bugs in conversation code (ask X about Y etc)
- Changed to 'buffer' and 'parse' for the player input and parsing
  arrays, since DM4 is describing them and renaming them breaks some
  existing Inform code and extensions needlessly.
- Examine now works as in the standard library: containers without a 
  description get a Search action, switchable objects show a message to
  say if they're on or off, after and react_after are run afterwards.
  Examining in darkness shows a message that it's dark.
- The contents of a closed transparent container are now printed in Look.
- Objects providing light now get "(providing light)" appended in Look.
- The message "[Actor] has better things to do." is now a regular library
  message, so it can be customized.
- Disambiguation bug fixed (only appeared in complex situations)
- "drop all but x" should now give a reasonable error message. ("but" is
  not supported.)
- Reordered the version info to mimic the standard library.

v1.2: bug fix release
- Messages for pushing, pulling and turning scenery objects were missing.
- You could use action Drop/Insert/PutOn with something worn without taking 
  it off first.
- "(worn)" was never shown in inventory.
- Library message for inventory slightly changed.
- Fixed bugs in handling of low priority scenery/concealed objects in 
  disambiguation
- Take improved so it's not possible to take things which are part of other 
  things or held by an NPC.
- TAKE ALL doesn't try to take other people's belongings or things that are
  part of other things anymore.
- "(putting x into [sack_object])" now has a newline at the end, and is
  printed by PrintMsg, so it can be modified by game.
- ObjectIsUntouchable() now has a flag to check if an object is takable too,
  like in the standard library.
- Added TouchCeiling() to help TAKE ALL.
- Changed so TAKE ALL tries to pick up all things in TouchCeiling plus things
  in/on normal containers/supporters in the touchceiling.
- Made game name bold in z5 games.
- Improved 'all' so that 'take all from X' and 'take all except X' work
