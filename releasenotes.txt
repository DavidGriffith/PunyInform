1.0: first public release (5 July 2020)

1.1: bug fix release (10 July 2020)
- parsing failed for big story files because of bad pointer comparisons
- a programming error lead to bad parsing results on older interpreters
- reimplemented darkness handling as described in DM4
- fixed various bugs in conversation code (ask X about Y etc)
- changed to 'buffer' and 'parse' for the player input and parsing
  arrays, since DM4 is describing them and renaming them breaks some
  existing Inform code and extensions needlessly.
