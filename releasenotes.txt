1.0: first public release (5 July 2020)

1.1: bug fix release (12 July 2020)
- parsing failed for big story files because of bad pointer comparisons
- a programming error lead to bad parsing results on older interpreters
- reimplemented darkness handling as described in DM4
- fixed various bugs in conversation code (ask X about Y etc)
- changed to 'buffer' and 'parse' for the player input and parsing
  arrays, since DM4 is describing them and renaming them breaks some
  existing Inform code and extensions needlessly.
- Examine now works as in the standard library: containers without a 
  description get a Search action, switchable objects show a message to
  say if they're on or off, after and react_after are run afterwards.
  Examining in darkness shows a message that it's dark.
- The contents of a closed transparent container are now printed in Look.
- Objects providing light now get "(providing light)" appended in Look.
- The message "[Actor] has better things to do." is now a regular library
  message, so it can be customized.
- disambiguation bug fixed (only appeared in complex situations)
- "drop all but x" should now give a reasonable error message. ("but" is
  not supported.)
- Reordered the version info to mimic the standard library.
