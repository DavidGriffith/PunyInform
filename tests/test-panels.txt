Do you mean the navigation panel, the engine panel or the cargo panel?

> examine navigation panel
You're only a sailor, not a navigator, so you don't understand what the controls
on the navigation panel are used for. However, you can see that the sonar shows
that the ship is only a few miles off the coast. With the engines off, the ship
will drift to shore within a few hours and the deadly chlorine gas could
potentially kill hundreds of people.
